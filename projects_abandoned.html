                    <p>It was cancelled due to difficulties with the asset creators.</p>

                    <h3>Sweetheart -forever mine- (2021)</h3>
                    <p>It was a 2d rpg game with a lot of graphic animated cutscenes and scenarios.</p>
                    <p>We never finished it due to someone leaking a alpha build wich ended up with people cancelling us.</p>
                    <p>It was the project we worked on the most.</p>
                    &nbsp
                    <h3>Itsukis Love (2021)</h3>
                    <p>This game was a yandere simulator inspired "fangame".</p>
                    <p>We worked on it in unity and later ported it to unreal engine.</p>
                    <p>We already had a working sandbox debug finished up and running, even featuring multiplayer.</p>
                    <p>You could even customize your anime character.</p>
                    <p>However due to hate and such we had to cancel the project.</p>
                    <p>Turns out yandereDev and his community did not like how similar our game looked or was to Yandere Simulator.</p>
                    <p>The game never got released sadly.</p>
                    &nbsp
                    <h3>Shady Place (2022)</h3>
                    <p>Developed in the Unity engine, this was a 3d fps horror game.</p>
                    <p>The player basically needed to break out of a facility while getting chased by SCP-1471-B.</p>
                    <p>The leading developer of that title ended his life due to mental problems sadly.</p>
                    <p>Rest in piece Eric.</p>
                    &nbsp
                    <h3>Fluffy FLoras Pizzeria Terror (2023)</h3>

                    <p>It featured 100% custom and selfmade assets like drawings and music.</p>
                    <p>Unfortunatly me and the artist for the needed pictures partet ways so we had to cancel this one.</p>
                    <p>You are not missing out on much tho, it would have probably been boring anyway.</p>
                    &nbsp
                    <h3>Floras Lost Levels (2024)</h3>
