                    <p>Team Cryptail startet of under the name NowaySoft back in 2020.</p>
					<p>Since then we had several rebrands, but decided this is the final one.</p>
					<p>We mainly acted in the background for other indie devs, or indie game studios.</p>
					<p>We also changed a lot in terms of the people working with and for us.</p>
					<p>From around 60 people to now just around 3 people.</p>
					&nbsp
					<p>We are ready for this new chapter of our journey and hope you guys are on our side.</p>
					<p>Our focus now will be smaller horror indie horror games and mods for already excisting ones.</p>
					<p>And as of right now we will purely do it for the fun, without intend on making money.</p>
					<p>Thanks for your interest!/p>
					<p>-Ceo and founder Flora Q.</p>
